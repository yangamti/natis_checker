# **Natis Checker Home Assistant Component**  

This custom Home Assistant component automates the process of checking the availability of service slots on the Natis platform and sends notifications if slots are found. It can schedule these checks randomly within specified time windows, with dynamic controls to start or stop the cron jobs.

---

- **API Integration**: Logs in to the Natis system and fetches available slots.  
- **Random Scheduling**: Runs **once at a random time** within each configured time window.  
- **Dynamic Control**: Start or stop the cron jobs using Home Assistant services.  
- **Notifications**: Sends alerts when slots matching your criteria are found.

## **How to Use**

### **Available Services**  
This component exposes the following services:

1. **Start Cron**  
   Service: `natis_checker.start_cron`  
   - This starts the cron jobs to run at random times within each predefined time window.

2. **Stop Cron**  
   Service: `natis_checker.stop_cron`  
   - This stops the cron jobs and cancels all scheduled updates.

### **Start Cron Automatically at Home Assistant Start**  
You can create an automation to start the cron jobs when Home Assistant starts:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Start Natis Checker Cron
    trigger:
      platform: homeassistant
      event: start
    action:
      service: natis_checker.start_cron
```

---

## **Time Windows Configuration**

The component runs **once at a random time within each of the following time windows**:

```python
time_ranges = [
    ["08:00", "09:30"],
    ["10:00", "11:30"],
    ["11:40", "14:00"],
    ["15:00", "16:30"],
    ["17:00", "18:30"],
    ["18:45", "20:00"],
]
```

You can modify the `time_ranges` list in the code to suit your needs.

---

## **Notifications**  
The component sends notifications using Home Assistantâ€™s notification service. Update the following part of the code to match your desired notification service:

```python
await self.hass.services.async_call(
    "notify",
    "your_notification_service",  # Replace with your service name
    {
        "title": title,
        "message": message,
    },
)
```

---

## **Logs and Troubleshooting**

Enable debug logging by adding the following to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.natis_checker: debug
```

Check logs in **Developer Tools > Logs** to verify if the component is running as expected.

---

## **Testing the Component**

1. Go to **Developer Tools > Services** in Home Assistant.
2. Select the `natis_checker.start_cron` or `natis_checker.stop_cron` service.
3. Verify the logs to see if the component runs at the scheduled random times.
